/**
 * Which system you are in, and which one the tablet will boot next.
 *
 * These stopped being the same question the moment writing the partitions was
 * split from restarting.  Once a set has been written the four partitions hold
 * the *other* system while this app keeps running on the old one, and that
 * gap can outlive the app: it is closed by a restart, not by a process.
 *
 * So the state is not kept in memory.  It is read back from the tablet every
 * time, from two sources that survive anything:
 *
 *  - the partitions themselves, hashed, say what will boot;
 *  - a note in preferences says what was running when the switch was staged.
 *
 * The note is only ever trusted when the partitions agree with it, so a
 * restart, a switch made from the Linux side, or a stale note all resolve the
 * same way: back to plain reality.
