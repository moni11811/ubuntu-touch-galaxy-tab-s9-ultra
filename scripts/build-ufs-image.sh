# Assemble the ext4 root filesystem image that the TWRP ZIP writes into the
# tablet's internal UFS.
#
# The image is a bare filesystem, not a disk: it carries no partition table,
# because it is written into a partition that already exists.  The installer
# copies it onto `userdata` with dd, so nothing on this device ever creates,
# moves, resizes or deletes a partition, and the GPT Samsung shipped stays
# exactly as it is.
#
# Unlike the microSD image there is no separate boot partition: /boot stays
# inside the root filesystem.  ABL loads the kernel from the `boot` partition
# and never reads a filesystem, so a second partition would carry nothing the
# tablet needs and would mean asking for a partition we are not going to make.
#
# It writes only to a regular file under the build base.  It never accepts a
# block device and therefore cannot overwrite the tablet or a card.

# -E resize=... is what lets first boot grow this filesystem to the whole
# userdata partition.  Without enough reserved group descriptor blocks,
# resize2fs on a 939 GiB partition would need an offline pass; with them the
# online resize on first boot is a few seconds.  The value is 1 TiB in 4 KiB
# blocks, which covers the 939 GiB userdata of every SM-X910 variant.
# -m 1 instead of the 5% default.  Two reasons.  The reserve is a percentage
# held in the superblock, so it survives the resize: 5% of the 469 GiB this
# filesystem grows into is 23 GiB the owner never gets back.  And before the
# resize it ate 180 MiB of a 3.6 GiB image, which left df reporting zero
# available and made the installer skip seeding the dual-boot sets every
# single time -- the sets need 216 MiB and there were 118.
