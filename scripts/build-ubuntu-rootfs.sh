#
#   yaru-theme-icon    without it only yaru-theme-gnome-shell arrives, the icon

#                      the keyring.  Without it no agent registers, joining a
#                      protected Wi-Fi never prompts for the password, and
#                      NetworkManager just logs "no secrets: No agents were
