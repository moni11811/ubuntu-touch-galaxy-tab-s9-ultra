## Tab Companion
<img width="2164" height="1764" alt="Screenshot from 2026-08-20 04-02-55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df7cddca-46e8-438a-bcb8-be713cc93bed" />

Tab Companion 1.0.0 is preinstalled and provides:

- full S Pen settings (pairing, gestures and air-pointer mouse mode);
- remapping for compatible Samsung Book Cover Keyboard keys;
- adjustable vibration feedback for GNOME's on-screen keyboard and optional notification vibration;
- dual boot to Android, with an optional toggle in quick settings.

The air-pointer concept is inspired by
[PenMouse S](https://github.com/jojczak/PenMouseS) by Jakub J (`@jojczak`).
Tab Companion uses an independent native Linux implementation.

## Installation

Both ways use the same installation ZIP. The only difference is whether you
split the UFS first.

> [!WARNING]
> Either way, **everything Android keeps in `userdata` is erased**: its apps,
> its settings and its files. Android's system itself is not touched. Back up
> anything you want to keep first. On another note, the project seems really stable so far, but as always: I'm not responsible for bricked devices, missing recovery partitions, nuclear wars or you getting fired because you forgot to boot back into android for the alarm.

### Before you start

1. **An unlocked bootloader.**
2. **Root with Magisk** (only if you want dual boot).
3. Get `ubuntu-24.04-sm-x910-vX.X.X.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/agcarbajo/ubuntu-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra/releases/latest). `gts9u-split.zip` and `Dualboot-vX.X.X.apk` only if you want dual boot.
4. **[TWRP](https://github.com/rainbowdashh/android_device_samsung_gts9u/releases/tag/V2)** and **a `vbmeta` with AVB verification disabled** ([the one published alongside TWRP](https://xdaforums.com/attachments/vbmeta-1-tar.6077784/)). Flash both files in the AP slot using Odin or Heimdall (you will need to reboot again to download mode between flashes).
5. After flashing both files from step 4 reboot to TWRP. **Don't let One UI boot** or TWRP will be overwritten with the stock recovery and you will need to flash the files again.

### Ubuntu on the whole tablet

1. From TWRP just flash the installation ZIP (`ubuntu-24.04-sm-x910-v1.0.0.zip`) using a microSD, external USB storage or sideload. **Don't flash it from internal storage** as it will get wiped.
2. Reboot and enjoy!

### Ubuntu beside Android

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The default split is 50% of the storage for Android and 50% for Linux. If you want to modify it just change the value of `ANDROID-PERCENT` inside `gts9u-split.zip` to the percentage you want Android to keep (between 5% and 95%).

1. Flash `gts9u-split.zip`. It shortens `userdata`, creates `linuxroot`
   beside it, and recreates Android's data so Android can make fresh encryption
   keys on its next boot.
2. Reboot to TWRP (Reboot > Recovery).
3. Wipe > Format Data.
4. Flash the installation ZIP (`ubuntu-24.04-sm-x910-v1.0.0.zip`).
5. Reboot and enjoy! (see below for how to reboot to Android).

### Switching systems

From **Ubuntu**, just use the toggle that you should see on quick settings or from the Tab Companion app under the Dualboot tab.

From **Android**, install the `Dualboot-vX.X.X.apk` app and give it root access, then reboot from the app or add the toggle to quick settings.

Both One UI and LineageOS have been tested in dual boot with Ubuntu and they work fine.

Liked the project? you might want to [buy me a coffee](https://paypal.me/agcarbajo1), I'll be very grateful!

## Known issues

- Regarding the official cover keyboard, as I said, only EF-DX920 cover keyboard has been tested. EF-DX900, EF-DX910, EF-DX915 and
EF-DX925 are untested as I don't have them, so they might not work.
- Text might not display correctly in some Chromium-based apps.
- Front cameras are zoomed in for some reason.

## Firmware and licensing

Keep in mind project has been made with the help of agentic AIs (codex and claude code), so some things might not be done in the best possible way.

Proprietary Samsung and Qualcomm firmware is not stored in Git. Build helpers
stage it from the owner's tablet or official Samsung firmware and verify pinned
checksums.

The project default license is MIT; per-file SPDX headers take precedence.
Kernel code and patches remain GPL-2.0-only, and the device tree remains
BSD-3-Clause. Imported sources are listed in
[kernel/PROVENANCE.md](kernel/PROVENANCE.md).

Contributions must be reproducible in the repository and validated on physical
hardware before a component is marked as working.
