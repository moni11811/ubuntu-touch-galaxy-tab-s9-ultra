# The EF-DX920 pogo keyboard, in one page

The Book Cover Keyboard Slim talks to an STM32G0 that lives **in the tablet**,
on I2C6 at address `0x2a`, not in the cover.  That controller runs one of two
applications, and only one of them works here:

| Version | Under Ubuntu | Under One UI |
|---|---|---|
| **V37** (Samsung's X910 blob) | works | works |
| V34 (older application) | announces no protocol ID; cover is dead | works |

The mainline driver reproduces Samsung's V37 start-up sequence.  V34 speaks a
different one: the controller boots fine, pulses the connection line every
~2.1 s and never sends `0xd6`.  That is the whole failure, and it looks exactly
like a wiring or timing problem, which is why it cost several sessions.

## Checking

```
cat /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/samsung-gts9u-stm32-pogo/*-002a/diagnostics
```

The Linux I2C adapter number is not stable when other controllers are added to
the kernel, so diagnostics and the automatic restorer locate the device through
its bound driver rather than assuming that it will always be `6-002a`.

`flash_version=00370037` is healthy.  `flash_version=00340034` means the
controller has been put back to V34 and the cover will not work until it is
restored.

## Restoring

`ubuntu-gts9u-pogo-firmware.service` does it automatically, once per boot,
whenever the version is not V37.  **Nothing else is required** — in particular
not the cover and not a charger.

The cover used to be required, on the assumption that the controller shared the
accessory's power rail.  Measured with the cover detached and `pogo_vddo`
disabled, the ROM bootloader still answered with its product id and flash
version: the rail that gets cut feeds the keyboard, while the controller sits on
the tablet's own I2C6.  So a controller found on V34 is repaired on the first
boot after an install whether or not the cover is anywhere near the tablet.

The only remaining condition is 15 % battery, and that is not protecting the
flash: the STM32 ROM bootloader cannot be erased, it answers on every boot, and
the driver re-reads all 52 KiB before reporting success, so an interrupted write
is simply completed on the next boot.  The threshold only avoids starting the
job on a tablet that is about to die mid-boot.

To run it by hand:

```
sudo /usr/libexec/ubuntu-gts9u-pogo-firmware-update
```

To stop it from ever writing:

```
sudo systemctl mask ubuntu-gts9u-pogo-firmware.service
```

## What still is not known

Nothing in this port ships a V34 image, so the downgrade does not come from
here.  The likely source is Samsung's own `stm32_pogo_v3` driver with its
vendor blobs, under One UI or under the Ubuntu Touch port.  If the cover stops
working after booting one of those, check `flash_version` first.
